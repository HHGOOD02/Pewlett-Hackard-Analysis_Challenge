# Overview
Due to the upcoming "Silver-Wave" of retirements, spurred on by aging baby boomers, there has been a growing concern as to whether or not our company will be able to
fill the roles that these upcoming retirees are to depart. 

The goal of this project is to take all employee data - which was previously managed in simple CSV files - and perform quantitative analysis to determine
whether or not the company is in a safe position to endure all of these retirements; and to begin making early course corrections if we are not.

# Results
- One of the most prominant facts we noticed during analysis is the sheer quantity of individuals who will be retiring in the near future. We are currently
looking at 72,000+ individuals who are eligible to retire, though it is important to note that this will not happen all at once. 
- By examining trends in the types of individuals who may be retiring in the near future, we can conclude that the majority of positions which will need
to be filled are those which reside in positions of significant seniority. This generates an immediate need to begin developing junior and mid level employees
to fill these roles when the time comes. 

# Recommendations
- We believe that the most efficient method to address this upcoming shortfall of senior level employees is to continue proliferating the "Employee Mentorship"
as widely as is feasible. In order to continue driving the company towards its vision, our current excellent management should be incentivized and encouraged
to train successors and those who they feel possess the necessary skills and qualifications to assume their position upon retirement.
